Currently hosted on: https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~connolr3/cw7025_december_2022/pongtitle.html


**Brief**

Create PONG, a classic tennis game
You've done this already, all you need to do is refactor your solution to include the concepts we've discussed over the past semester.
- Have one computer-operated bat and one user-operated bat
- If the user or the computer misses a ball they get one point deducted from their total (start with 10 each)
- First one to 0 loses
- Show/keep track of the number of times the player won and the number of times the computer won 

I want to see your solution in action: store your solution in a folder named cw7025_december_2022 on your personal www directory on scss.tce.ie
Upload your solution to your personal www and send me the link scss.tcd.ie/~<your_user_name>/cw7025_december_2022/ (all lowercase)
If you can send me a link to your git repository, that would be much appreciated, but it's optional.

*Deadline: *
Sunday the 18th of December at 23:59

*Criteria:*
- Does it work? Are there no glitches?
- Structuring your solution properly: javascript files in the correct folder, css, images if needed. Is everything sourced properly in the HTML?
- Legibility of the code. Use correct indentation and spacing, is there lots of code commented out?
- The right amount of abstraction, containing the right variables and functions.
- Correctly naming variables and functions.
- Record how long it takes (seconds) before you win a game and store that as your high score.
- Use of jQuery.
- Correctly using classes.
- Creativity, what can you do to wow the gamer? Think sound effects, graphics, boosts (temporary larger paddle, bigger ball), other?
